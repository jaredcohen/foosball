##Overview
This application is a web based table for standings in a foosball league. While it can be utilized for any kind of individual or team based competition, it is uniquely focused on enabling users to track individual statistics for people who are constantly teaming up with other individuals.

##Build Process
This foosball application was built using grails because that was the fastest tool available for getting an initial POC setup, that the initial developer was familiar with. If you do not have grails, then the easiest way to install it is by utilizing yum, apt-get, brew, or whatever package installer your operating system provides.
